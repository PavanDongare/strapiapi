1) no compulsory 'relation' fields possible ?
2) no raw sql allowed? only orm access to database?

so far only advantage?
1) auth table
   sign in 
   login 
   password confirmation
   for every table in db
      get by id
      post by id
      delete by id
      get all
      
      
      these are automatically created
